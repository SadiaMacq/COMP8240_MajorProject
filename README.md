# COMP8240_MajorProject

# Default Project
<br>
Following is an augmented recap from the proposal presentation.

In terms of the Overall Goal and Assessment Criteria for the project as a whole, you will focus in this presentation on the following two criteria:

# Replication of original work: 
As getting fastText to work is fairly straightforward, this will be very brief.  Just note which aspects of the tutorial you explored (e.g. using bigrams? using hierarchical softmax? using pretrained embeddings?).

# New data: 
For this classification task, you would typically have aimed for one new dataset per team member (i.e. 4 for most of you).  You should describe where this data came from, and what its properties are (e.g. is it multilabel, like the sample fastText tutorial dataset?).  Datasets that require more work to create are more interesting and worth more to create. 

Each new dataset should be presented by the team member who will be gathering and working on this data.

You should also describe here which aspects of the tutorial you investigated on your new datasets.  For example, seeing whether the improvement from using pretrained embeddings on the original dataset also holds on the new datasets.
